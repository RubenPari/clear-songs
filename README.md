## üéØ Usage Examples

### Complete Workflow Example

1. **Authenticate with Spotify**

   ```bash

   http://localhost:3000/auth/login
   ```

2. **Analyze your library**

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/track/summary"
   ```

3. **Remove artists with only 1 track (cleanup singles)**

   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/track/range?min=1&max=1"
   ```

4. **Clean up a specific playlist**

**Remove duplicate artists (keep only artists with 10+ tracks):**

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/track/range?min=1&max=9"
```

**Clean library and specific playlist simultaneously:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/playlist/tracks/all?id=PLAYLIST_ID"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Considerations

### Backup System

- All track deletions are automatically backed up to PostgreSQL
- Recovery is possible through direct database access
- Consider implementing a recovery endpoint for easier restoration

### Rate Limiting

- Spotify API has rate limits - the application handles these gracefully
- Large operations are automatically paginated

### Recommendations

1. **Test First**: Always test with a small playlist or artist first
2. **Backup**: Although automatic backup is provided, consider exporting your library before major operations
3. **Verification**: Use the summary endpoint to verify changes
4. **Gradual Approach**: For large libraries, perform operations in smaller chunks
